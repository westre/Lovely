Attack Points: points you have to destroy other PVP's players blocks
You gain AP by: killing mobs, killing players, staying in PVP mode (offline & online) and maybe some more shit
You lose AP by: destroying other blocks, dying
Victim will get notification if he is being attacked
- Offline victim = x10 cost modifier
- Online victim = x1 cost modifier

Changing PVE/PVP modes only near your bed

When you kill a PVP player: a chest will spawn at the victim's location, only the victim can enter said chest
Other chest of PVP player can be entered, takes a long time to enter

PVE players normally
PVE players when you die, maybe 5% of your placed blocks will be removed, or creepers will be spawned

-----
maybe a supply/demand system where you can exchange materials for AP
